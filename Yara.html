    <h1>Yara</h1>
    <h2>Character Art</h2>
    <p><b>Faction:</b> The High Order<br>
        <b>Alignment:</b> Lawful Evil<br>
        <b>Lore:</b> Coming from a long line of genetically gifted heirs to the shady High Order. Yara is a high priestess that uses her power to command an arsenal of knives.
        She is a cold hearted, sharp minded woman, with precise features,a gosthly white complexion and frightening red eyes. 
        
        Her team mates are more important than life itself. Even if she seems cold and unforgiving at the surface, she ows her life to them. 
        She is loyal dedicated to her beliefs and will give anything to achieve her goals â€” even her life.
